# predictive accuracy and explained variation in Cox regression

The measures of predictive accuracy and explained variation in Cox regression 
presented in Schemper and Henderson 2000 and also dealt with in Schemper 2003 
can be computed by means of a SAS macro. 

SAS code: 
The ZIP archive contains the files 
surev.sas (the SAS macro), 
surev.pdf (a short documentation of macro options),  
example.sas (a SAS file containing the myeloma data set analyzed by Schemper 
and Henderson 2000, and an example macro call)

R function:
The function f.surev() from an R package developed by L. Lusa, Miceli and Mariani 
in 2007 as well as R functions provided by Janez Stare has been updated by Hana 
Sinkovec in 2019.
